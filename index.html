            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I worked in construction for about 8 years. I was an electrician in the USAF Reserves for 6 years. I studied some in a community college nearby. I was inthe US Army for about 3.5 years. That was when I decided after getting out, that I wanted to get into the industry of software development.</p>
